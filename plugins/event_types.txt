Plugin Architecture Documentation
===========================================

Hubbub plugins are very simple in that the platform offers a series of events for which developers can 
write handler functions. Convention dictates that each plugin have a separate folder inside the 
plugins/ directory. Inside that folder must be a file called manifest.txt which contains configuration
options for the plugin. An entry called "events" must be present that announces which events the plugin
hooks into. For example:

  events=user_new,display_post

In this example, the plugin offers integration for the "new user" event and a display handler for
messages with the type "post". Each plugin must also have a file called events.php that has the actual
event handling functions. The functions must be named according to the following convention:

  $PluginName$_$FunctionName$

where $PluginName$ is the name of the plugin directory and $FunctionName$ is the name of the event
the function is supposed to handle. For example, the handler function for user_new inside a plugin
called "friendlyui" would look like this:

  function friendlyui_user_new(&$entityDS, &$userDS) {...}

As a general rule, plugin event handlers should not disrupt the normal program flow. For example, they
should not cancel or modify user actions. With the exception of display handlers, they should also not
print any output on the screen.

Supported Events
=============================================

USER EVENTS:
- user_new(&$entityDS, &$userDS)
  gets called every time a new user is created
- user_save(&$entityDS, &$userDS)
  when user data is committed to local storage
- user_logout(&$entityDS, &$userDS)
  when a user logs off from Hubbub
- user_login(&$entityDS, &$userDS)
  shortly after a user logs into the server

MESSAGE EVENTS:
The general naming format of the message events is "msg_$type$_$event$_$time$" where $type$ is the message
type and $event$ is the message event. $time$ is either "init" or "done" depending on whether the handler
should be called before the base system performs its inbuilt handlers or after. Please note that "done" 
events do not necessarily mean that data has been committed to DB or the network. The following message 
events are generally supported for all messages:
- create(&$data, &$msgObject)
  shortly after a new message object is initiated
- load(&$data, &$msgObject)
  after a message is loaded from DB
- save(&$data, &$msgObject)
  before a message is saved to disk
- receive(&$data, &$msgObject)
  when a message is received (from a remote endpoint)
- receive_single(&$data, &$msgObject)
  when a message is received as part of a stream
- send_notifications(&$data, &$msgObject)
  when direct message notifications are sent
- before_sendtourl(&$data, &$msgObject)
  after_sendtourl(&$data, &$msgObject)
  server one-on-one message calls

CUSTOM MESSAGE DISPLAY:
Message types that are not handled by internal templates can be hooked up to the following event:
- show_$messagetype$(&$data, &$ds)
  where $messagetype$ is the type of message to be displayed
  
Hubbub handles the display of the standard message types internally. However, plugins can modify
message data or inject additional code via the 
- display_$messagetype$(&$data, &$ds, &$flags) event.

The $flags array offers a mechanism to inject additional information into a message. Supported are
- $flags['cmd'] = array('<a href="bla">my link</a>')  
  to add one or more command links or short infos to a message
- $flags['infoblock'] = 'some text'
  adds an arbitrary HTML segment below the message text
