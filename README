Prototype:
The source code for the protoype is no longer available, let's pretend it never existed. 
It was horrible, and hence true to its purpose, which it served well.

Installation:
Please don't install this, yet. It doesn't work. When it starts working, this message will
change. But if you must, pull down the repository and execute the installer by opening up
the pertinent location in your browser. Follow the instructions.

A word about "pretty" URLs:
We are using the standard URL rewrite rule that Wordpress uses (RewriteRule . index.php [L]),
this maps an arbitrary URL and hands it over to index.php. 
On Apache, the necessary .htaccess file is created automatically by the installer, please 
make sure mod_rewrite is enabled in your config.
On NGINX, you can simply insert or modify the try_files directive in your nginx.conf to
include index.php (plus the path to your installation if needed):
  try_files $uri $uri/ index.php;
