Prototype:
The source code for the protoype is no longer available, let's pretend it never
existed. It was horrible, and hence true to its purpose, which it served well.

Installation:
Please don't install this, yet. It doesn't work. When it starts working, this
message will change. But if you must, pull down the repository and execute the
  > setup/tables.sql 
script. Then clone the example config file in 
  > conf/example.com.php
and rename it to whatever your server name (domain) is. If you have no idea what
your server name is, look at the $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] variable. If you install
Hubbub in a subdirectory within your domain (like http://bob.com/hubbub), you 
should open the .htaccess file and change the RewriteBase line to whatever your
subdirectory is. All done! Yes, we will try to automate this, but it'll be a while.
